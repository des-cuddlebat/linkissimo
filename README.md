# Linkissimo
Link items in chat. Mod for Fabric 1.15.2.

## Usage
* alt-shift-rightclick items in player inventory
* [h=#] to link item in hotbat slot #
* [s=_] to link item in slot _ (valid slots: mainhand, offhand, head, chest, legs, feet)

Usages can be freely mixed, for example "[s=head] or [h=1]?" to compare currently worn helmet with item in first hotbar slot.

Only the first functionality requires the mod to be installed on client, [h=#] and [s=#] and tooltips in chat are all handled serverside an will work for vanilla clients.
